==== the library abstract ===
"Legos for landing pages and the extended universe (about us, yadda yadda)"

main directions:
	+ an actual vast library of screenshots, snippets, ..
		+ even just doing this manually for 2 hours, it turns out as a massive undertaking, impossible to do manually
			+ seems like tagging and categorzing etc... in some machine understandable format is inevitable
				+ json that has the filename and then some under it.... so the filename is the "ID" basically
			+ possibly also describe them in my meta language
			+ tagging by...
				+ layout
				+ colors
				+ the "meaning"
					+ showing the actual novelty / USP
					+ showing off other great features
					+ credibility
				+ compatibility with imagery, flavors, etc... (for snippets especially)
		+ the graphical way makes it easy to avoid all the bullshit surrounding react vs angular, bootstrap v tailwind BLA BLA FUCKING BLA
	+ a creativity tool to mix and match patterns and come up with new stuff
		+ MVP
			+ instead of creating the real deal, just mix and match the text descriptions and then read through them
				+ without a visual rep
			+ create random brand identities
				+ color schemes khroma
				+ font
				+ amount of space
			+ 
	+ a meta language to quickly create layouts (in bootstrap)
	+ a machine to spit out landing pages (templates) in an original way and requiring as little manual intervention as possible
		+ random sequence of generic bootstrap containers
		+ random sequence of partial screenshots
		
Problem:
+ my problem is with coming up with a flow, new ideas, etc...
	that moment when someone commissions a "website" and now you stare at a blank canvas, writer's block
+ browsing all these Bootstrap UI libraries, it becomes painfully obvious that the actual implementation is never the problem
	but much more coming up with fresh ideas for content, ...
+ there are layout kits for designers (for Ps,Sketch) but almost none at all for frontend code
	or usually every kit only contains like 10 sections and 5 boring ass pages
+ I want to create endless templates for sale but certainly not handwrite them from scratch every time
+ there are enough blocks and there are enough designs out there
	what's not there is something that puts together creative new ideas to help you come up with something
+ clients don't know what they want
	=> something like a collection of very or slightly different templates to get a preference
		=> like always giving two options and them picking one over the other.

Collection of Designs / Imagery / Screenshot partials:
+ It is an endless job
+ would be easier automated
+ 

Random Landing Page Generator:
+ just put nav, header, content, footer in order, everything random
+ you can like a section (which makes it stay) and its position in the site (for content parts)
+ slot / interface system
	+ but then, these interfaces themselves can be swapped out 
	+ landing page = 1-2 nav slots, 1 header slot, 1-7 content slots, 1 footer slot
		+ nav slot = 1 logo slot, 1 nav element collection, 1 cta area
		+ header slot = 
		
	
Blackbox thinking / let's skip the collection of endless modules.
+ pretending I already have a large ass collection of sections and components, fully mapped, tagged, categorized, interfaceazzled, ...
	+ getRandom(nav, header, getRandomContent(7), footer)
	+ equalizeWidth()
	+ equalizeColors
	+ replaceWith( moreText )
	+ replaceWith( largerImagery )
	+ replaceWith( AppleStyle )
	
	

of course as a great designer this is a bit of bullshit because you will always want to come up with that one original thing, like the iPhone landing page started the trend for "scroll magic", things that hadn't usually been done before or were considered "too artsy / out there"
so maybe a good idea is to use these rules / components but then always add that one or two very "out there" things

an endless amount of partial screenshots / screenvideos (replayed like the scroll animations, frame by frame) and code snippets, described by keywords like here:
	+ left-right, Imagery, animation, magic, mobile, grid, masonry, ....
	+ also keywords maybe on what is displayed (esp on screenshots): features list
	+ automatically rate snippets by things like: readability, amount of "words" used (less is better), ...
	+ optimally auto suggest plenty of those keywords
	+ imagery is easier to combine, cause the snippets can easily interfere with each other's classes, css, ...

it's basically an extension to css, a high-level way of expressing layouts
an extension to bootstrap to emulate often-used patterns
	things bootstrap already has: cards, buttons, navigation
	things bootstrap doesn't have: 2 part layout premade, header premade, ...


systematically store screenshots / graphics or even sites
	maybe I could somehow download pages and give them markers to point to certain parts
	otherwise screenshots would be good
	in the long run, all that data will be perfect to create a ML algo that can recognize layouts entirely
	
limitations of the library
	wording (no text itself)
	Imagery (cause that highly depends)
	actual functioning if Interactives
	melding / blurring of lines (a two parter where one part "bleeds" over into the neighbor both horizontal and vertical)
	every single part that seems trivial can have infinite variations: fonts, buttons, imagery, ...
		so actually abstractifying makes it easier, avoiding all the creativity
	
	
Instead of being a website builder, be a website accelerator:
 + give feedback
 + analyze metrics automatically
 + guide the dev and designer instead of trying to replace their work
	
	
Crawling:
	+ optimal would be a great AI 
	+ for now, manually is easier
		+ copy (time-intense)
		+ analyze by markup full size screenshots
			+ layout chunks
			+ color
			+ font
			+ subtleties
		+ how does it reflect the subject nature?
			+ established / big:
				+ space. lots of space. Letting you breathe
			+ reading / authors / ..
				+ serif font
			+ we take you seriously:
				+ dark theme
				+ sophisticated screenshottery
			+ education:
				+ calm, neutral colors, clean shapes, repetition, patterns
			+ showbiz
				+ wowsers, xxl headings, ...
			+ food, groceries, ..
				+ visceral, colorful
				+ restaurants
					+ lots of photography, out-of-the-ordinary layouts			
	more important than I thought:
		+ length and shape of copy
		+ the art of screenshottery
		+ 
			


	
Features:
	+ really, these basic elements I identified are already enough. Now would be the time to automate variations:
		+ Position and size of heading on top hero
		+ Font
		+ Color composition
			+ categories: 
				+ background colors
				+ 
			+ constraints:
				+ contrast of text on background
				+ contrast of stripe backgrounds
	+ and automate combining different things
		+ triple threat x videos
		+ left-right x sticky


landing page / website design categorization
	the Apple: interactive, animated, Wowser
	the sober: classic elements from head to toe, all about copy and education
	the ugly: a seemingly ugly design that is easy on the eyes and has amazing copy
	the artsy: all kinds of animations, left is down and right is through
	the wordpress agency: some kind of cms / template like design that is a solid mix of classic elements and beautiful design





wider vision
	train AI model to recognize existing pages and then learn to create new ones from that.


class System
	{Name} implements Two-Parted
		this.left = Container{large heading, navigation}
		this.right = carousel[Card{icon, Testimonial, Button}]


design patterns / rules
	the order / sequence of content stays the same, no matter what format (because it has a purpose anyway)
		e.g. the header stays on top and the footer on bottom. The logo strip on top, the feature overview in middle
	there is a narrative top to bottom
		common: hero, logos, short description, feature overview, testimonials, FAQ, footer
	

mechanics
	desktop to mobile
		two-part (left, right) desktop becomes two part (top, bottom) mobile


Global / overarching
	brand / identity	
		color palette
		font
		spacing
		logo
	responsive widths
		e.g. apple landing page's content has only one width after > 1069px screen width to insure consistency of spacing effects etc...
			and only one mobile breakpoint after 735, so only 2 breakpoints total!
	scrollmagic
	width of desktop experience
		e.g. apple landing pages are narrower than most on desktop (except full format imagery)
	narrative system
		rhythms / patterns
			different background colors per section (looking like striped in overview)
			horizontal rhythm of spacing
			slalom: image left, then image right, then image left, etc...
	fixed / floating elements
	splittability
		most sections basically work independently and stay together no matter whether mobile or desktop and the order of section-to-section stays the same

Flavor
	bucket of trendy:
		tiles
		appear when scrolling into view
	subtleties:
		consistent sizing
			the iPad is the exact same size in almost all mockups on its landing page
	interactions
		scrollmagic
			elements appear when scrolled into view / disappear when scrolling back up
			animations / videos start / continue running while scrolling
	animations
		colors
			background
				"turn the lights of" cinematic and then "turn the lights on" to "wake up" again (ipad air landing)
		Videos
		SVGs
		images with css transform
		other
			animate HTML itself 
			animate first impression, to catch attention without interaction
			ticker
				an array of elements running continuously horizontally
					licke a stock ticker on TV
					e.g. logos running 
					carousel going automatically
	overlapping
	shapes
		take some Imagery and crop it in unusual shapes and forms
	bleeding out 
		containers not ending with a horizontal line or blank but a diagonal or otherwise shape
		allow pictures to "escape" the grid / standard width
	supersize
		make a section larger than or equal 100vh
	Typesetting
		make text narrower than the heading
	Spacing
		lots of "air" between sections
		have the space in the images interact with typesetting
	effects
		blurring
		overlay an almost transparent color / gradient, kind of like a mist of mood, unnoticeable
		other blend modes
Original / secrete ingredient (stuff that before had only been done in arts sites or never)
	Apple with the scroll animations
	amie.so with the sounds and the twitter stuff on the side
