==== the library abstract ===

of course as a great designer this is a bit of bullshit because you will always want to come up with that one original thing, like the iPhone landing page started the trend for "scroll magic", things that hadn't usually been done before or were considered "too artsy / out there"
so maybe a good idea is to use these rules / components but then always add that one or two very "out there" things

it's basically an extension to css, a high-level way of expressing layouts
an extension to bootstrap to emulate often-used patterns
	things bootstrap already has: cards, buttons, navigation
	things bootstrap doesn't have: 2 part layout premade, header premade, ...


systematically store screenshots / graphics or even sites
	maybe I could somehow download pages and give them markers to point to certain parts
	otherwise screenshots would be good
	in the long run, all that data will be perfect to create a ML algo that can recognize layouts entirely
	
limitations of the library
	wording (no text itself)
	Imagery (cause that highly depends)
	actual functioning if Interactives
	melding / blurring of lines (a two parter where one part "bleeds" over into the neighbor both horizontal and vertical)
	every single part that seems trivial can have infinite variations: fonts, buttons, imagery, ...
		so actually abstractifying makes it easier, avoiding all the creativity
	
	

wider vision
	train AI model to recognize existing pages and then learn to create new ones from that.


class System
	{Name} implements Two-Parted
		this.left = Container{large heading, navigation}
		this.right = carousel[Card{icon, Testimonial, Button}]


design patterns / rules
	the order / sequence of content stays the same, no matter what format (because it has a purpose anyway)
		e.g. the header stays on top and the footer on bottom. The logo strip on top, the feature overview in middle


mechanics
	desktop to mobile
		two-part (left, right) desktop becomes two part (top, bottom) mobile


Global / overarching
	brand / identity	
		color palette
		font
		spacing
		logo
	responsive widths
		e.g. apple landing page's content has only one width after > 1069px screen width to insure consistency of spacing effects etc...
			and only one mobile breakpoint after 735, so only 2 breakpoints total!
	scrollmagic
	width of desktop experience
		e.g. apple landing pages are narrower than most on desktop (except full format imagery)
	narrative system
		rhythms / patterns
			different background colors per section (looking like striped in overview)
			horizontal rhythm of spacing
			slalom: image left, then image right, then image left, etc...
	fixed / floating elements
	splittability
		most sections basically work independently and stay together no matter whether mobile or desktop and the order of section-to-section stays the same

Flavor
	bucket of trendy:
		tiles
		appear when scrolling into view
	interactions
		scrollmagic
			elements appear when scrolled into view / disappear when scrolling back up
			animations / videos start / continue running while scrolling
	animations
		Videos
		SVGs
		images with css transform
		other
			animate HTML itself 
			animate first impression, to catch attention without interaction
			ticker
				an array of elements running continuously horizontally
					licke a stock ticker on TV
					e.g. logos running 
					carousel going automatically
	overlapping
	shapes
		take some Imagery and crop it in unusual shapes and forms
	bleeding out 
		containers not ending with a horizontal line or blank but a diagonal or otherwise shape
		allow pictures to "escape" the grid / standard width
	supersize
		make a section larger than or equal 100vh
	Typesetting
		make text narrower than the heading
	Spacing
		lots of "air" between sections
		have the space in the images interact with typesetting
	effects
		blurring
		other blend modes
Original / secrete ingredient (stuff that before had only been done in arts sites or never)
	Apple with the scroll animations
	amie.so with the sounds and the twitter stuff on the side
