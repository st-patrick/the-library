# the-library
perfect frontend library

translating popular frontend patterns into reusable bootstrap combos

common patterns, components, etc...
kind of like tailwind but instead of standardizing details, it standardizes combinations

aka "the familiar" ... cause it's things that are so common now, you feel familiar about them so most designs implement some variation of it 

"the rough cut" which also often is the most work that is automatable. Spacing, color, images, ... require "feeling"


Basically shorthand codes would be good that translate that indented overview into bootstrap
most easily CTA -> <button{...}


feature ideas:
+ browse templates by outline description
+ brose templates visually


MVP:
+ a compiler that turns the highly abstract indented syntax into bootstrap HTML as a starting point
